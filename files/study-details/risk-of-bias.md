# Risk of bias table
([switch to PICO table](pico-table.md))
## Randomized controlled trials
Based on [Cochrane Handbook](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/table_8_5_d_criteria_for_judging_risk_of_bias_in_the_risk_of.htm). Modifications are:
* Selective reporting bias is high risk if trial protocol is not registered.(PMID [26244868](https://pubmed.gov/26244868))
* Incomplete outcome data is unclear risk of Consort diagram is not provided.

Content is based on Chaparro et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 PMID: [23983011](http://pubmed.gov/23983011) except:
* Selective reporting bias as noted above
* Newer studies
